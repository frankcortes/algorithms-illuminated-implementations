# Algorithms Illuminated's Implementations ![image](https://api.travis-ci.com/frankcortes/algorithms-illuminated-implementations.svg?branch=main)

This repository contains my own nodejs implementations for the problems described
in [the Algorithms illuminated series' books](https://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/) ([part I](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Illuminated-Part-1-Basics/dp/0999282905), [part II](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Illuminated-Part-Graph-Structures/dp/0999282921)).

# Tests

Check `Test Cases and Data Sets for Programming Projects` in the [the Algorithms illuminated series' website](https://www.algorithmsilluminated.org/) to know more about them.

```bash
nvm use
npm i
npm test
```
